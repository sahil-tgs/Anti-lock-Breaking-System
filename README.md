# Anti-lock-Breaking-System# Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) Simulation

This project is a small-scale model of an Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) for cars using an Arduino board. It simulates the working of an ABS and demonstrates how it prevents the wheels from locking up during sudden braking.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino Uno board
- 2 x IR Speed Sensors (e.g., FC-03)
- 2 x DC Motors with wheels
- L298N Motor Driver Module
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## Hardware Setup

1. Connect the IR Speed Sensors to the Arduino Uno:
  - Connect the VCC pin of each sensor to the 5V pin of the Arduino.
  - Connect the GND pin of each sensor to the GND pin of the Arduino.
  - Connect the OUT pin of the first sensor to digital pin 2 of the Arduino.
  - Connect the OUT pin of the second sensor to digital pin 3 of the Arduino.

2. Connect the L298N Motor Driver Module to the Arduino Uno:
  - Connect the VCC pin of the module to the 12V external power supply.
  - Connect the GND pin of the module to the GND of the external power supply and the GND pin of the Arduino.
  - Connect the ENA and ENB pins of the module to digital pins 5 and 6 of the Arduino, respectively.
  - Connect the IN1 and IN2 pins of the module to digital pins 7 and 8 of the Arduino, respectively (for the first motor).
  - Connect the IN3 and IN4 pins of the module to digital pins 9 and 10 of the Arduino, respectively (for the second motor).

3. Connect the DC Motors to the L298N Motor Driver Module:
  - Connect the positive and negative terminals of the first motor to the OUT1 and OUT2 of the module, respectively.
  - Connect the positive and negative terminals of the second motor to the OUT3 and OUT4 of the module, respectively.

## Software Setup

1. Install the Arduino IDE on your computer.
2. Open the `abs_simulation.ino` sketch in the Arduino IDE.
3. Connect the Arduino Uno board to your computer using a USB cable.
4. Select the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE.
5. Upload the code to the Arduino Uno.

## Testing the ABS Simulation

1. Power the L298N Motor Driver Module with an external 12V power supply.
2. Place the wheels on a surface and observe the behavior of the system when braking.
  - When both wheels are rotating and you apply braking, the wheels should slow down gradually.
  - If you forcefully stop the wheels to simulate sudden braking, the ABS should activate, and you should observe the wheels pulsing rapidly to prevent locking.

## How It Works

- The code uses two IR speed sensors to detect the rotation of the wheels.
- Each sensor is connected to an interrupt pin of the Arduino to count the pulses generated by the sensor.
- The speed of each wheel is determined by the number of pulses counted in a specific time interval.
- If both wheels are detected to be locked (zero speed), the ABS logic is triggered.
- During ABS activation, the motors are briefly stopped and then pulsed to simulate the rapid application and release of brakes.
- If the wheels are rotating, normal braking is applied by running the motors at a constant speed.
